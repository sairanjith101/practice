16. Immediate Smaller Element

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [2, 1, -1, 3, -1]
Explanation: [ Array elements are 4, 2, 1, 5, 3. Next to 4 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2.
             Next of 2 is 1 which is smaller,so we print 1.
             Next of 1 is 5 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 5 is 3 which is smaller, so we print 3.
             Note that for last element, output is always  going to be -1 because there is no element on right.]

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 7]
Output: [-1, 2, -1, 1, -1, -1]
Explanation: [ Next to 5 is 6 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 6 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2.
             Next of 2 is 3 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 3 is 1 which is smaller, so we print 1.
             Next of 1 is 7 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Note that for last element, output is always going to be -1 because there is no element on right. ]

Input: arr[] = [4, 1]
Output: [1, -1]
Explanation: 4 will be updated to 1 and 1 will be updated to -1.
