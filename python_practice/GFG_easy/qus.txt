15. First Occurence

Examples :

Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "Fr"
Output: -1
Explanation: Fr is not present in the string GeeksForGeeks as substring.

Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "For"
Output: 5
Explanation: For is present as substring in GeeksForGeeks from index 5 (0 based indexing).

Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "gr"
Output: -1
Explanation: gr is not present in the string GeeksForGeeks as substring.


16. Immediate Smaller Element

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [2, 1, -1, 3, -1]
Explanation: [ Array elements are 4, 2, 1, 5, 3. Next to 4 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2.
             Next of 2 is 1 which is smaller,so we print 1.
             Next of 1 is 5 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 5 is 3 which is smaller, so we print 3.
             Note that for last element, output is always  going to be -1 because there is no element on right.]

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 7]
Output: [-1, 2, -1, 1, -1, -1]
Explanation: [ Next to 5 is 6 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 6 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2.
             Next of 2 is 3 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Next of 3 is 1 which is smaller, so we print 1.
             Next of 1 is 7 which is greater, so we print -1.
             Note that for last element, output is always going to be -1 because there is no element on right. ]

Input: arr[] = [4, 1]
Output: [1, -1]
Explanation: 4 will be updated to 1 and 1 will be updated to -1.

17. LCM And GCD

Examples:

Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.

Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.

Input: a = 1 , b = 1
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.

18. Sum of first n terms

Given an integer n, calculate the sum of series 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + â€¦ till n-th term.

Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 225
Explanation: 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 225

Input: n = 7
Output: 784
Explanation: 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 = 784
