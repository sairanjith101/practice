1. Missing in Array

You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing.
Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.

Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.

2. Second Largest

Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array.
If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.

3. Array Duplicates

Given an array arr of integers, find all the elements that occur more than once in the array.
If no element repeats, return an empty array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.

Input: arr[] = [0, 3, 1, 2] 
Output: [] 
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.

Input: arr[] = [2]
Output: [] 
Explanation: There is single element in the array. Therefore output is empty.
