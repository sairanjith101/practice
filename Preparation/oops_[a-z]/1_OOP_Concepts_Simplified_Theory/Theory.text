1.1 Encapsulation

Bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

Example: Making variables private and accessing them via methods.

1.2 Abstraction

Hiding complex internal implementation details and showing only essential features.

Achieved through abstract classes or interfaces.

1.3 Inheritance

Acquiring properties and behavior (methods) from another class.

Promotes code reusability.

1.4 Polymorphism

Same interface, different implementation.

Method Overriding and Overloading.
